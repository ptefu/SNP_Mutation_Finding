SNP_Mutation_Finding

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (Mutation) search in a sequence from NCBI database. Implements approximate string matching using a seed-and-check strategy based on exact matching using the Burrows-Wheeler transform.

Question: A specific mutation (H275Y) in the NA gene confers resistance to Oseltamivir, making the drug less effective. A note about nomenclature: the code H275Y encodes a substitution in position 275 (1-based indexing), changing aminoacid H (Histidine) to Y (Tyrosine). Do the reads correspond to a gene sequence with this mutation?

Answer: Yes, reeds correspond to the mutation. More information can be found in file, "CMSC423_Proj4_Notebook"
